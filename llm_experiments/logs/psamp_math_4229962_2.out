Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$
 

Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. 

First, let me recall the formulas to convert from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, θ). I think the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, mathematically, that would be r = √(x² + y²). 

Given the point (0,3), so x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging these into the formula, r should be √(0² + 3²) which is √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3. So, r is 3. That seems straightforward.

Now, onto θ. The angle θ is calculated using the arctangent function, I believe. The formula is θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, in this case, x is 0. So, if I plug in x = 0 into arctan(y/x), that would be arctan(3/0). Hmm, 3 divided by 0 is undefined. I remember that dividing by zero is undefined, so I need to think about this differently.

I recall that when x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. Since y is positive (3), the point is on the positive y-axis. In polar coordinates, the angle θ is measured from the positive x-axis. So, if the point is on the positive y-axis, what is the angle?

Thinking about the unit circle, the positive y-axis corresponds to an angle of π/2 radians. Because at π/2, the coordinates are (0,1), and scaling that by any r would just be (0, r). So, in this case, since r is 3, the point is (0,3), which is exactly 3 units up the y-axis. Therefore, θ should be π/2.

Wait, let me confirm that. If I have a point (0, y) where y is positive, then θ is π/2. If y were negative, θ would be 3π/2. Since y is positive here, it's π/2. That makes sense.

But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me think about the unit circle. At 0 radians, we're on the positive x-axis. At π/2 radians, we're on the positive y-axis. At π radians, we're on the negative x-axis, and at 3π/2 radians, we're on the negative y-axis. So, yes, (0,3) is at π/2 radians.

Alternatively, I can think about the direction of the point. Since it's directly above the origin on the y-axis, it's pointing straight up, which is 90 degrees, and 90 degrees is π/2 radians. So, that aligns with what I thought earlier.

Is there another way to confirm this? Maybe using the sine and cosine functions. In polar coordinates, x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. So, if I have x = 0 and y = 3, and r = 3, then plugging into these equations:

0 = 3 cos θ => cos θ = 0
3 = 3 sin θ => sin θ = 1

So, cos θ = 0 implies that θ is π/2 or 3π/2 because those are the angles where cosine is zero. However, sin θ = 1 implies that θ is π/2 because that's where sine is 1. So, combining these two, θ must be π/2. That confirms it.

Another way to think about it is using the unit circle. The point (0,3) is three units up the y-axis, so when we normalize it by dividing by r (which is 3), we get (0,1). That corresponds to an angle of π/2. So, θ is π/2.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's consider the general case when converting rectangular to polar coordinates. The formulas are:

r = √(x² + y²)
θ = arctan(y/x)

But when x is 0, arctan(y/x) is undefined because division by zero isn't allowed. So, in such cases, we have to determine θ based on the location of the point. Since x is 0 and y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis, which is θ = π/2. If x is 0 and y is negative, it's θ = 3π/2.

So, in this problem, since x is 0 and y is positive, θ is π/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

Let me just visualize this to make sure. If I plot the point (0,3) on the rectangular coordinate system, it's straight up along the y-axis, three units away from the origin. In polar coordinates, that's a radius of 3 and an angle of π/2 radians from the positive x-axis. That seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that when x is 0, the angle is either π/2 or 3π/2, depending on whether y is positive or negative. Since y is positive, it's π/2. And the radius is just the distance from the origin, which is 3.

So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinate \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we need to find \(r\) and \(\theta\).

First, we calculate \(r\) using the formula:
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
Given \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\), we have:
\[ r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]

Next, we determine \(\theta\). Since \(x = 0\) and \(y\) is positive, the point lies on the positive \(y\)-axis. The angle \(\theta\) for this position is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

Thus, the polar coordinates are:
\[ (r, \theta) = \left(3, \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \]

\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
\]

 Hmm, I've got to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Alright, so polar coordinates are in the form (r, θ), where r is the radius and θ is the angle. I remember that the formulas to convert from rectangular (x, y) to polar are r = √(x² + y²) and θ = arctan(y/x). So let me apply that here.

First, let's calculate r. The coordinates are (0, 3), so x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging into the formula, r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3. So, the radius r is 3. That part seems straightforward.

Now, onto θ. This is where it might get tricky because when x is 0, the formula θ = arctan(y/x) becomes arctan(3/0). Wait, 3 divided by 0 is undefined, right? I remember that dividing by zero is undefined in math because you can't divide by nothing. So, arctan of an undefined value. Hmm, how does that work?

I think I need to figure out the angle θ such that when you convert back to rectangular coordinates, you get (0, 3). Let me recall the relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates. The angle θ is measured from the positive x-axis in the counterclockwise direction. So, in this case, since our point is (0, 3), that's straight up along the y-axis. So the angle would be 90 degrees, or π/2 radians.

But wait, let's make sure. If I'm at the origin and move along the positive x-axis, that's 0 radians. If I move up along the positive y-axis, that should be 90 degrees or π/2. Then, as I go back towards the negative x-axis, it's 180 degrees or π, and then down to the negative y-axis is 270 degrees or 3π/2, and back to the positive x-axis at 360 degrees or 2π. So yeah, (0,3) is on the positive y-axis, so θ should be π/2.

But let me double-check using limits because when x approaches 0 from the positive side, y is positive, so θ approaches π/2. If x is 0 and y is positive, we should get θ = π/2. Similarly, if x is 0 and y is negative, it would be θ = 3π/2. So, in this case, since y is positive, θ is π/2. Okay, so I think θ is π/2.

Wait a second, but let me think in terms of another approach. Polar coordinates can represent any point in the plane except the origin, and each has a unique representation given certain conditions. In this case, we have x=0 and y=3, so it's a point on the y-axis. In rectangular coordinates, a point on the y-axis has x=0, and its y can be positive or negative.

Let me remember the conversion formulas: r = √(x² + y²) is always correct, regardless of the signs. So that gives me r=3. Then θ is determined by the arctangent of y over x. But if x=0, as here, then y is positive. So, in this situation, if y is positive, θ is π/2, and if y is negative, θ is 3π/2.

So, since in this case, y=3, which is positive, θ is π/2. That adds up. Alternatively, is there another way to find θ? Maybe using sine and cosine.

In polar coordinates, x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ.

Given x=0 and y=3, and r=3.

So plug these into the equations: 0=3 cos θ and 3=3 sin θ.

Let me solve these:

First, 3 sin θ = 3, dividing both sides by 3 gives sin θ = 1.

And 3 cos θ = 0, dividing both sides by 3 gives cos θ = 0.

So, sin θ = 1 and cos θ = 0. Okay, so when is sin θ = 1? At θ = π/2. Because sin(π/2) = 1. Cos θ = 0 where θ is π/2 or 3π/2.

Wait, let's evaluate cos(π/2) and cos(3π/2). Cos(π/2) is 0, yes, and cos(3π/2) is also 0. So θ could be π/2 or 3π/2, but sin θ must be 1, so it's only π/2. If it were sin θ = -1, that would be 3π/2.

So, yeah, that confirms what I thought earlier, θ is π/2.

Therefore, polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

Hold on, to ensure thoroughness, sometimes points with x=0 or y=0 require special consideration because they lie on the axes themselves. In the case of x=0, that lies on the y-axis, either positive or negative. In polar coordinates, if θ=0, you're on the positive x-axis, θ=π/2 is positive y-axis, θ=π is negative x-axis, and θ=3π/2 is negative y-axis.

So another way to think of this is to identify the quadrant. If x is 0, then the point lies on the y-axis. Since y is positive, it's in the first quadrant if x can be positive, but x is 0.

But polar coordinates can handle being on the axis. The point (r, θ) can lie precisely on those axes.

But anyway, from the conversion, we have r=3 and θ=π/2, so that's the answer.

Is there any more verification I can do?

Yes, by plugging back into the conversion formulas.

So, given r=3 and θ=π/2, then x = r cos θ = 3 cos(π/2) = 3(0) = 0.

And y = r sin θ = 3 sin(π/2) = 3(1) = 3.

Therefore, we get (x, y) = (0, 3), which is our original point.

So, that works! So, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

Alternatively, if I had used other methods, perhaps looking at the graph.

In the coordinate system, the point is on the positive y-axis, which is 90 degrees, or π/2 radians from the positive x-axis, with a distance of 3 units, so that all makes sense.

Therefore, I believe (3, π/2) is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates of the point (0, 3) are \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinate \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and \( \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \).

1. Calculate \( r \):
   \[
   r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

2. Determine \( \theta \):
   - Since \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 3 \), the point lies on the positive \( y \)-axis.
   - The angle \( \theta \) for points on the positive \( y \)-axis is \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).
   - Verification using \( x = r \cos \theta \) and \( y = r \sin \theta \):
     - \( x = 3 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0 \)
     - \( y = 3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 3 \)

Thus, the polar coordinates are \((3, \frac{\pi}{2})\).

\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}

Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. 

First, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). I think the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, r = √(x² + y²). That makes sense because it's like using the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by x and y.

Given the point (0,3), x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging these into the formula for r: r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3. So, r is 3. That seems straightforward.

Now, I need to find θ. I remember that θ can be found using the arctangent function because tanθ = y/x. But wait, in this case, x is 0, so tanθ = 3/0. Hmm, division by zero is undefined, so I can't use that formula directly. I need to think about what angle θ would make tanθ undefined.

When is tanθ undefined? Well, tanθ is sinθ/cosθ, and it's undefined when cosθ is 0. That happens at θ = π/2 and θ = 3π/2 in the interval [0, 2π). So, θ is either π/2 or 3π/2. But which one is it?

Looking at the point (0,3), it's on the positive y-axis. So, in rectangular coordinates, when x is 0 and y is positive, the point is at the top of the y-axis. That corresponds to an angle of π/2 radians from the positive x-axis. If it were 3π/2, that would be pointing downward along the negative y-axis, which is not the case here.

Therefore, θ should be π/2.

So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). Let me just double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, calculating r: √(0² + 3²) = √9 = 3. That seems correct.

Then, for θ, since x is 0 and y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis, which is π/2. That makes sense because in the unit circle, π/2 is straight up, which is where the point (0,3) is located, scaled by the radius 3.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the polar coordinates should be (3, π/2).

Define
\[p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.\]Find a way to write
\[\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$
 

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to express a double infinite sum in terms of two known constants, p and q. Let me write down what I know:

First, p is defined as the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k², which I recognize as the famous Basel problem. The value of p is known to be π²/6. Then, q is the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k³, which is known as Apéry's constant, approximately 1.2020569... But I don't think I need the numerical value here; I just need to express the double sum in terms of p and q.

The double sum I need to evaluate is:

\[
\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}
\]

Hmm, so this is a double sum over j and k, each starting from 1, and the term is 1 divided by (j + k) cubed. I need to find a way to relate this to p and q.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can change variables or find a clever way to express this sum. Since the denominator is (j + k)^3, perhaps I can fix the sum m = j + k and then sum over m. That is, for each m, find all pairs (j, k) such that j + k = m, and then sum 1/m³ over all such pairs.

Yes, that seems promising. Let me try that.

So, let me define m = j + k. Then, for each m, j can range from 1 to m - 1, and k would be m - j. So, for each m, the number of pairs (j, k) is m - 1. Therefore, the original double sum can be rewritten as:

\[
\sum_{m = 2}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} \frac{1}{m^3}
\]

Wait, hold on. Because j and k both start from 1, the smallest m is 2 (when j=1, k=1), and the largest m goes to infinity. So, the outer sum is from m=2 to infinity, and for each m, the inner sum is over j from 1 to m - 1, but since k is determined once j is fixed, each term is 1/m³.

So, the inner sum is just adding 1/m³ (m - 1) times, right? Because for each m, there are (m - 1) terms, each equal to 1/m³. Therefore, the inner sum is (m - 1)/m³.

Therefore, the entire double sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{m - 1}{m^3}
\]

Simplify that expression. Let's write (m - 1)/m³ as (m/m³ - 1/m³) = 1/m² - 1/m³.

So, the sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{m = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{m^3} \right ) = \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^2} - \sum_{m = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3}
\]

But I know that p is the sum from m=1 to infinity of 1/m², so the first sum is p minus the first term, which is 1/1² = 1. Similarly, q is the sum from m=1 to infinity of 1/m³, so the second sum is q minus the first term, which is 1/1³ = 1.

Therefore, substituting back, we have:

\[
(p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q
\]

Wait, that simplifies nicely to p - q. So, is the answer just p - q?

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I changed variables to m = j + k, which is a standard technique for double sums. For each m, j ranges from 1 to m - 1, so k = m - j.

2. Then, I expressed the double sum as a single sum over m, with each term being (m - 1)/m³.

3. I split (m - 1)/m³ into 1/m² - 1/m³.

4. Then, I expressed the sum from m=2 to infinity as (sum from m=1 to infinity) minus the m=1 term.

5. Therefore, the first sum becomes p - 1, and the second sum becomes q - 1.

6. Subtracting these gives p - q.

That seems correct. Let me verify with a small example to see if the logic holds.

Suppose I take a finite version of the sum, say up to m=3.

Original double sum:

j=1, k=1: 1/(1+1)^3 = 1/8

j=1, k=2: 1/(1+2)^3 = 1/27

j=2, k=1: 1/(2+1)^3 = 1/27

j=1, k=3: 1/(1+3)^3 = 1/64

j=2, k=2: 1/(2+2)^3 = 1/64

j=3, k=1: 1/(3+1)^3 = 1/64

So, total sum up to m=4:

1/8 + 1/27 + 1/27 + 1/64 + 1/64 + 1/64

Wait, actually, m goes up to 4 in this case, since j and k go up to 3.

But let me compute the sum as per my method:

For m=2: (2 - 1)/2³ = 1/8

For m=3: (3 - 1)/3³ = 2/27

For m=4: (4 - 1)/4³ = 3/64

So, total sum is 1/8 + 2/27 + 3/64.

Compute this:

1/8 = 0.125

2/27 ≈ 0.07407

3/64 ≈ 0.046875

Total ≈ 0.125 + 0.07407 + 0.046875 ≈ 0.245945

Now, compute p - q:

p = π²/6 ≈ 1.644934

q ≈ 1.2020569

So, p - q ≈ 1.644934 - 1.2020569 ≈ 0.442877

Wait, but my finite sum was approximately 0.245945, which is less than p - q. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the finite case. Let me compute the finite sum more carefully.

Wait, in the finite case, I considered j and k up to 3, so m goes up to 4. But in the original problem, the sum is up to infinity. So, in the finite case, the sum should approach p - q as the upper limit increases.

But in my small example, it's only up to m=4, so it's not close yet. Let me compute more terms.

Wait, maybe I should compute the finite sum up to m=2, m=3, m=4, and see if it's approaching p - q.

Wait, let me compute the sum up to m=2:

Sum = 1/8 ≈ 0.125

Sum up to m=3:

1/8 + 2/27 ≈ 0.125 + 0.07407 ≈ 0.19907

Sum up to m=4:

0.19907 + 3/64 ≈ 0.19907 + 0.046875 ≈ 0.245945

Sum up to m=5:

4/125 ≈ 0.032

Total ≈ 0.245945 + 0.032 ≈ 0.277945

Sum up to m=6:

5/216 ≈ 0.023148

Total ≈ 0.277945 + 0.023148 ≈ 0.301093

Continuing:

m=7: 6/343 ≈ 0.0175

Total ≈ 0.301093 + 0.0175 ≈ 0.318593

m=8: 7/512 ≈ 0.01367

Total ≈ 0.318593 + 0.01367 ≈ 0.332263

m=9: 8/729 ≈ 0.01097

Total ≈ 0.332263 + 0.01097 ≈ 0.343233

m=10: 9/1000 = 0.009

So, as m increases, the sum is approaching something. Let me see, p is about 1.6449, q is about 1.2020569, so p - q is about 0.442877. So, the sum is approaching that as m goes to infinity.

So, in my finite case, up to m=10, the sum is about 0.352, which is still less than 0.442877, but it's increasing. So, that suggests that my method is correct because as m increases, the sum approaches p - q.

Therefore, my conclusion that the double sum equals p - q seems correct.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using generating functions or integral representations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express 1/(j + k)^3 as an integral. I know that 1/n³ can be written as an integral from 0 to 1 of x^{n - 1} dx integrated again, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: maybe swap the order of summation.

Wait, the original double sum is over j and k from 1 to infinity of 1/(j + k)^3. If I fix n = j + k, then for each n, the number of pairs (j, k) is n - 1, as before. So, the sum is sum_{n=2}^\infty (n - 1)/n³, which is exactly what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the double sum as sum_{j=1}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty 1/(j + k)^3 = sum_{j=1}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty integral_{0}^{1} x^{j + k - 1} dx, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, actually, 1/(j + k)^3 can be expressed as an integral. Let me recall that:

1/n^3 = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} (-\ln x)^2 dx

Is that correct? Let me check.

I know that \int_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} dx = 1/n, and integrating with respect to parameters can give higher powers. Let me see:

First, note that \int_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} dx = 1/n.

Then, differentiating both sides with respect to n:

\int_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} \ln x dx = -1/n²

Differentiating again:

\int_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} (\ln x)^2 dx = 2/n³

Therefore, 1/n³ = (1/2) \int_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} (\ln x)^2 dx

So, substituting back into the original sum:

sum_{j=1}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty 1/(j + k)^3 = sum_{j=1}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2) \int_{0}^{1} x^{j + k - 1} (\ln x)^2 dx

Then, swapping the sum and the integral (assuming convergence allows it):

(1/2) \int_{0}^{1} (\ln x)^2 sum_{j=1}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty x^{j + k - 1} dx

Simplify the sum inside:

sum_{j=1}^\infty x^{j - 1} = sum_{j=0}^\infty x^{j} - 1 = 1/(1 - x) - 1 = x/(1 - x)

Similarly, sum_{k=1}^\infty x^{k - 1} = x/(1 - x)

 Hmm, I've come across this interesting math problem involving infinite series. Let me try to parse it out step by step. So, the question is asking to express the double sum

\[
\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}
\]

in terms of two constants, \( p \) and \( q \), which are defined as:

\[
p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{(the Basel problem)}
\]
\[
q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \quad \text{(Apery's constant)}
\]

Alright, my goal is to find a way to rewrite this double infinite sum using only \( p \) and \( q \). Let's start by understanding what each part represents.

First, \( p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \) is a well-known series that converges to \( \pi^2/6 \), though the exact value isn't crucial here since we're expressing the result in terms of \( p \) and \( q \). Similarly, \( q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \) converges to approximately 1.202, again a famous constant but again, we're using it symbolically.

Now, looking at the double sum:

\[
\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}
\]

This looks a bit complicated because it's a double sum, and the denominator depends on both \( j \) and \( k \) in a linear way.

Let me think – perhaps I can find a way to transform this double sum into a single sum or relate it to the known sums \( p \) and \( q \). One approach that often works with double sums is to change the variables to make it more manageable. Maybe by letting \( n = j + k \) or something like that.

Wait, if I let \( n = j + k \), then for each fixed \( n \), \( j \) can range from 1 to \( n - 1 \), since \( k \) would then be \( n - j \). This is a common technique in dealing with such sums.

So, let's attempt to reindex the double sum in terms of \( n \) and \( j \) or \( k \). Let's fix \( n = j + k \), so for each \( n \), \( j \) can be from 1 to \( n - 1 \), as I thought. Therefore, the double sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1} \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. The original double sum is over all \( j, k \geq 1 \). By setting \( n = j + k \), for each \( n \), \( j \) can range from 1 to \( n - 1 \) because if \( j = 1 \), then \( k = n - 1 \), and so on until \( j = n - 1 \), \( k = 1 \). So, yes, for each \( n \geq 2 \), there are \( n - 1 \) terms.

Therefore, the sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \left( \sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1} \frac{1}{n^3} \right ) = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3}
\]

Since \( \sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1} \frac{1}{n^3} \) is just the number of terms, \( n - 1 \), multiplied by \( 1/n^3 \). So,

\[
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3}
\]

This simplifies the problem to computing a single sum, which is more manageable. Let me see, can I separate this fraction:

\[
\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \frac{n}{n^3} - \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

Yes, that seems right. So, substituting back into the sum, we have:

\[
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right ) 
\]

Which can be split into two separate sums:

\[
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

Now, let me recall the original definitions of \( p \) and \( q \). The sum \( p \) starts from \( k = 1 \), and the sum \( q \) does as well. But here, both sums start from \( n = 2 \). So perhaps I can relate these to \( p \) and \( q \) by expressing each as the original sum minus the first term.

So, let's compute \( p = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - \frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1 \).

Similarly, \( q = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - \frac{1}{1^3} = q - 1 \).

Therefore, substituting back into our expression, we have:

\[
(p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1
\]

Simplify that:

The -1 and +1 cancel each other out, so we're left with \( p - q \).

Hold on, that seems too straightforward. So, is the original double sum equal to \( p - q \)?

Let me just step back and verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake in reindexing.

1. Original double sum: \( \sum_{j,k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \).

2. Changing variables to \( n = j + k \) for each \( n \geq 2 \); for each \( n \), \( j \) ranges from 1 to \( n - 1 \), as \( k = n - j \).

3. For each \( n \), the inner sum \( \sum_{j=1}^{n - 1} \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \). But since \( j + k = n \), it's \( \sum_{j=1}^{n - 1} \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{n - 1}{n^3} \).

4. Then the outer sum becomes \( \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right ) \).

That's correct.

5. Calculating each sum: \( \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 \) and \( \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1 \).

6. Subtraction: \( (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q \).

Yes, each step seems solid. The critical point is realizing that the double sum can be reinterpreted as a single sum over \( n = j + k \), breaking the terms accordingly, then expressing everything in terms of \( p \) and \( q \).

Therefore, it looks like the original sum simplifies neatly to \( p - q \).

Just to sanity check, I can estimate the sums numerically to see if the relationship holds.

We know that \( p = \pi^2/6 \approx 1.6449 \) and \( q = \zeta(3) \approx 1.2020 \). Therefore, \( p - q \approx 1.6449 - 1.2020 = 0.4429 \).

On the other hand, the original double sum can be approximated numerically for a finite number of terms to see if it's roughly 0.4429.

Let's compute it for small \( j \) and \( k \), say up to 10 each. But wait, calculating a double sum up to 10 in each index would take 100 terms, which would give an approximation. However, due to the convergence, the terms decay as \( 1/n^3 \), so the tail sums should be manageable.

But in real terms, the exact value in decimal is roughly 0.4429 which is about \( p - q \).

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the double sum analytically in another way to confirm. Let me try switching the order of summation, though I think it would lead somewhere similar.

Wait, actually, switching the order of summation in the original double sum: \( \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \).

If we swap \( j \) and \( k \), it's still the same sum, hence symmetric in \( j \) and \( k \). But perhaps I could represent the double sum as \( (j + k)^3 \) and use generating functions or some Fourier analysis, but maybe Catalan's identity or something else.

Wait, another approach: Using the integral representation of \( 1/n^3 \).

We know that for \( s > 1 \), \( 1/n^s = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \int_0^\infty t^{s - 1} e^{-n t} dt \). So, for \( s = 3 \), \( 1/n^3 = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^\infty t^2 e^{-n t} dt \). Maybe that can help.

So, expressing \( 1/(j + k)^3 = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^\infty t^2 e^{-(j + k) t} dt \).

Then, plugging into the sum:

\[
\sum_{j, k =1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j, k =1}^\infty \int_0^\infty t^2 e^{-(j + k) t} dt
\]

Switching the order of summation and integration (if permissible), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_0^\infty t^2 \left( \sum_{j=1}^\infty e^{-j t} \right ) \left( \sum_{k=1}^\infty e^{-k t} \right ) dt
\]

Each of these sums is a geometric series:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^\infty e^{-j t} = \frac{e^{-t}}{1 - e^{-t}} = \frac{1}{e^{t} - 1}
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_0^\infty t^2 \left( \frac{1}{e^{t} - 1} \right )^2 dt
\]

Which simplifies down to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_0^\infty \frac{t^2}{(e^{t} - 1)^2} dt
\]

Hmm, this integral might relate to some known constants or functions. Let me recall that the integral \( \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{s - 1}}{(e^{t} - 1)^n} dt \) is related to the Riemann zeta function. Specifically, for \( n = 3 \), perhaps?

But wait, in this case, we have \( n = 2 \) in the denominator. Let me recall the formula:

For integer \( n \geq 1 \), \( \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{s - 1}}{(e^{t} - 1)^n} dt = \Gamma(s) \zeta(n, s) \), but I think I need to double-check.

Wait, perhaps more precisely, the Bose-Einstein integral, which is \( \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{s}}{(e^{t} - 1)^\nu} dt = \Gamma(s + 1) \zeta(\nu, s + 1) \). Hmm, maybe not exactly. Maybe I consider writing down the integral in terms of the gamma function and zeta function.

Wait, another way is to express \( 1/(e^t - 1)^2 = 1/(e^t (e^t - 1)) \). Hmm, but perhaps more direct.

Wait, similar to the Euler-Maclaurin formula? Maybe not immediately.

Wait, actually, instead of going through the integral, perhaps I can relate this back to \( p \) and \( q \). But stepping back, in my initial approach, I obtained \( p -
