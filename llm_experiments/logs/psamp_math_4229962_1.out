Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$
 

Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. 

First, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). I think r is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, so r = sqrt(x² + y²). And θ is found using the arctangent function, θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, I also remember that sometimes arctan(y/x) might not give the correct angle because of the quadrant the point is in. So, I need to be careful about that.

Alright, let's plug in the values for the point (0,3). So, x is 0 and y is 3. Let me compute r first. 

r = sqrt(0² + 3²) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That seems straightforward.

Now, onto θ. Since x is 0, plugging into θ = arctan(y/x) would be arctan(3/0). Wait, 3 divided by 0 is undefined. Hmm, so arctan is undefined here. That must mean that the angle is either π/2 or 3π/2 because those are the angles where the tangent is undefined (since cosine would be zero, making tangent undefined). 

But which one is it? Since the point is (0,3), which is on the positive y-axis, the angle should be π/2 radians, right? Because π/2 is 90 degrees, pointing straight up along the y-axis. If it were 3π/2, that would be pointing straight down along the negative y-axis.

Let me double-check. In rectangular coordinates, (0,3) is three units up the y-axis. So, in polar coordinates, that should correspond to a radius of 3 and an angle of π/2. 

But just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me recall the unit circle. At π/2 radians, the coordinates are (0,1). So, scaling that by r, which is 3, we get (0*3, 1*3) = (0,3). That's exactly our point. So, that checks out.

Wait, but sometimes when x is 0, it's easy to get confused. Let me think about another point where x is 0, say (0, -3). That would be 3 units down the y-axis, so in polar coordinates, that would be (3, 3π/2). So, in our case, since y is positive, it's π/2. 

Therefore, θ is π/2. 

So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). 

But just to be thorough, let me visualize the point. On the Cartesian plane, (0,3) is on the y-axis, three units above the origin. So, from the origin, if I go straight up three units, that's the point. In polar coordinates, that's a radius of 3 and an angle of π/2. 

I think that makes sense. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes θ can be represented in different ways by adding multiples of 2π, but since the problem specifies that θ should be between 0 and 2π, π/2 is already within that range, so we don't need to adjust it. 

Also, r has to be positive, which it is in this case (r = 3). So, that's good. 

I don't think I made any errors here. So, I'm confident that the polar coordinates for (0,3) are (3, π/2).

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinate \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for \(r\) and \(\theta\).

First, we calculate \(r\) using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Next, we determine \(\theta\). Since \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\), the point is on the positive \(y\)-axis. The angle \(\theta\) for this point is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) because it points straight up along the \(y\)-axis.

Thus, the polar coordinates are:
\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
\]

Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius, or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. But wait, how exactly do I calculate those values?

Let me think. I recall that the formulas to convert from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, θ) coordinates are:

r = sqrt(x² + y²)  
θ = arctan(y / x)

So, in this case, the rectangular coordinate is (0,3). Therefore, x is 0 and y is 3. Let me plug those values into the formulas.

First, let's compute r. That would be the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, plugging in 0 for x and 3 for y:

r = sqrt(0² + 3²) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3.

Okay, that seems straightforward. So r is 3. Now, I need to find θ. This is a bit trickier because x is 0 in this case. Normally, θ is calculated using arctan(y / x), but if x is 0, we have to be careful because dividing by zero isn't defined. Hmm, what does that mean for the angle?

I remember that if x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. Since y is positive 3, the point is on the positive y-axis. In the rectangular coordinate system, when x is 0 and y is positive, that corresponds to an angle of π/2 radians, which is 90 degrees.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not just confusing myself. Is it always π/2 when x is 0 and y is positive? Let's think about the quadrants. In the rectangular coordinate system, the origin is the center, and we have four quadrants. Quadrant I is where both x and y are positive, Quadrant II where x is negative and y is positive, Quadrant III where both are negative, and Quadrant IV where x is positive and y is negative. 

Wait, our point is (0,3), so x is 0 which is between the two sides of Quadrant II and I. But since y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis. So the angle should be going counterclockwise from the positive x-axis to the point (0,3). That would be 90 degrees, or π/2 radians. 

Similarly, if we had (0, -3), that would be on the negative y-axis, with angle 3π/2 radians. So, for x = 0 and y positive, θ is π/2; if y is negative, θ is 3π/2. That makes sense. 

Also, if x is positive and y is positive, it's in Quadrant I, so θ would be arctan(y / x) which is arctan(3 / 0). Wait, 3 / 0 is undefined? Hmm, but I remember that arctan approaches π/2 as the argument goes to infinity. So, in this case, x is 0, which leads θ to be π/2. 

Wait, now I feel a bit more confident that θ is indeed π/2 radians or 90 degrees, since the point is on the positive y-axis. 

So, putting it all together, r is 3 and θ is π/2. Therefore, the polar coordinate should be (3, π/2). I can represent this in a box as needed, but I want to double-check.

Just to recap:

Given (x, y) = (0,3)
r = sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(0 + 9) = 3
θ = angle, considering that x=0 and y positive: π/2.

Yes, that seems right. Let me visualize the coordinate plane. Starting from the origin, moving 0 units along the x-axis and 3 units up the y-axis. That's exactly where (0,3) is. In polar coordinates, that distance from the origin is 3, and the angle from the positive x-axis is π/2 radians, pointing directly upwards along the y-axis. 

Wait a moment, sometimes when x is 0, especially in polar coordinates, do I have to consider the angle relative to another axis or something? But no, since x=0, theta is either π/2 or 3π/2, depending on the sign of y. Here y is positive, so pi/2. If it were negative, it'd be 3pi/2. So I think that's correct.

Another way to check is to convert the polar coordinates back to rectangular to make sure we get (0,3). Let's see. The formulas to convert polar to rectangular are:

x = r cos θ  
y = r sin θ

So, plugging in r = 3 and θ = pi/2.

x = 3 cos(pi/2). What's cos(pi/2)? 0.

y = 3 sin(pi/2). What's sin(pi/2)? 1.

So, x = 0 and y = 3*(1) = 3. Perfect, that brings us back to (0,3). So that confirms that our polar coordinates are indeed correct.

Is there any other thing to check? Maybe edge cases. For instance, if theta is 0, then polar coordinates (r,0) would translate to (r,0) in rectangular coordinates, which is on the positive x-axis. If theta is pi, that's (-r,0). If theta is pi/2, it's (0,r). Similarly, theta 3pi/2 is (0,-r). So, for x = 0, the theta can only be pi/2 or 3pi/2. Since y is positive, theta is pi/2.

Wait, hold on, let's consider theta at pi/2. So cos(theta) is cos(pi/2) = 0, sin(theta) = 1, as we've used above.

Let me think about points on the axes. If a point is on the x-axis, say (5,0), then in polar coordinates that's (5,0). If it's (-5,0), then theta would be pi.

On the y-axis, whether positive or negative: (0,5) is (5, pi/2), and (0,-5) is (5, 3pi/2). Okay, so that matches. Thus, (0,3) is (3, pi/2), which as I found earlier.

Just think if we get confused with something else. Sometimes if points are on the axes, people might consider approaching theta from the positive side or from the negative side. But regardless, theta is defined to be the smallest angle when moving counterclockwise from the positive x-axis, so pi/2 is correct in this case.

Therefore, I feel confident that converting (0,3) from rectangular to polar coordinates gives us (3, pi/2).

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2})}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinate \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas:

\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
\[ \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \]

Given the point \((0, 3)\), we have \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\).

First, we calculate \(r\):

\[ r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{0 + 9} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]

Next, we determine \(\theta\). Since \(x = 0\) and \(y\) is positive, the point \((0, 3)\) lies on the positive \(y\)-axis, which corresponds to an angle of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

Thus, the polar coordinates are \((3, \frac{\pi}{2})\).

To verify, we convert the polar coordinates back to rectangular coordinates:

\[ x = r \cos(\theta) = 3 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 3 \times 0 = 0 \]
\[ y = r \sin(\theta) = 3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 3 \times 1 = 3 \]

This confirms that the polar coordinates are correct.

### Final Answer
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2})}.

Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. 

First, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). I think the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, r = √(x² + y²). And for θ, I believe it's the arctangent of y over x, so θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, I also remember that sometimes arctan(y/x) doesn't give the correct angle because it depends on the quadrant where the point is located. So, I need to be careful about that.

Alright, let's apply this to the point (0,3). So, x is 0 and y is 3. Let me compute r first. Plugging into the formula, r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That makes sense because the point is 3 units above the origin on the y-axis, so the distance from the origin is 3.

Now, onto θ. Since x is 0, plugging into θ = arctan(y/x) would be arctan(3/0). Hmm, wait, division by zero is undefined. So, I can't just compute it directly like that. I need to think about what angle θ would give me when the point is on the y-axis.

When x is 0, the point lies either on the positive y-axis or the negative y-axis. In this case, y is 3, which is positive, so the point is on the positive y-axis. What angle does that correspond to? Well, on the unit circle, the positive y-axis is at an angle of π/2 radians from the positive x-axis. So, θ should be π/2.

Let me verify that. If θ is π/2, then converting back to rectangular coordinates should give me (0,3). The conversion formulas are x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. So, x = 3 cos(π/2) and y = 3 sin(π/2). Cos(π/2) is 0, and sin(π/2) is 1. So, x = 0 and y = 3. Perfect, that matches the original point.

Wait, just to make sure, are there any other angles between 0 and 2π that would also give me (0,3)? Let's see. If θ was 5π/2, that's equivalent to π/2 because 5π/2 is just 2π + π/2, which brings us back to the same position. But since θ has to be between 0 and 2π, 5π/2 is outside that range. So, the only valid angle in the given interval is π/2.

So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). Let me just write that in the required format: (r, θ) = (3, π/2). 

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I calculated r correctly, handled the division by zero by recognizing the position on the y-axis, and confirmed that the angle is indeed π/2. Also, converting back to rectangular coordinates gave me the original point, so that checks out.

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2})}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinate \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\). 

First, we calculate \(r\) using the formula:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Substituting \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\):
\[
r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Next, we determine the angle \(\theta\). Since \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\) is on the positive \(y\)-axis, the angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).

Thus, the polar coordinates are:
\[
(r, \theta) = \left(3, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2})}\).

Define
\[p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.\]Find a way to write
\[\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$
 

Okay, so I have this math problem here where I need to express a double infinite sum in terms of two known constants, p and q. Let me write down what I know.

First, p is defined as the sum from k equals 1 to infinity of 1 over k squared. That is,

\[ p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \]

And q is similar but with cubes:

\[ q = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \]

So, p is the famous Basel problem, which I remember equals π²/6, and q is Apery's constant, approximately 1.2020569..., but I don't think I need its exact value here.

The main task is to find a way to write the double sum:

\[ \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \]

in terms of p and q. Hmm, okay. So, this is a double sum over j and k, each going from 1 to infinity, of 1 over (j + k) cubed.

I need to find a clever way to express this. Maybe I can manipulate the sum somehow or find a substitution that relates it to p and q.

Let me think about how to approach this. One idea is to fix the sum s = j + k and then express the double sum as a sum over s, multiplied by the number of ways j and k can add up to s.

Wait, that sounds like a convolution or something. Let me try that.

So, for each fixed s, the number of pairs (j, k) such that j + k = s is (s - 1). Because j can be from 1 to s - 1, and k is determined as s - j. So, for each s ≥ 2, the number of pairs is s - 1.

Therefore, the double sum can be rewritten as:

\[ \sum_{s=2}^\infty \frac{s - 1}{s^3} \]

Because for each s, we have (s - 1) terms each contributing 1/s³.

So, now the problem reduces to computing:

\[ \sum_{s=2}^\infty \frac{s - 1}{s^3} \]

Which is the same as:

\[ \sum_{s=2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{s^2} - \frac{1}{s^3} \right) \]

Because (s - 1)/s³ = 1/s² - 1/s³.

So, this sum is equal to:

\[ \left( \sum_{s=2}^\infty \frac{1}{s^2} \right) - \left( \sum_{s=2}^\infty \frac{1}{s^3} \right) \]

But notice that the first sum is p minus the first term, which is 1/1² = 1. Similarly, the second sum is q minus 1/1³ = 1.

So, substituting back, we have:

\[ (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q \]

Wait, so does that mean the double sum is equal to p - q?

Let me verify that step again. So, starting from:

\[ \sum_{s=2}^\infty \frac{s - 1}{s^3} = \sum_{s=2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{s^2} - \frac{1}{s^3} \right) \]

Which is:

\[ \left( \sum_{s=2}^\infty \frac{1}{s^2} \right) - \left( \sum_{s=2}^\infty \frac{1}{s^3} \right) \]

But since p is the sum from s=1 to infinity of 1/s², which is 1 + 1/2² + 1/3² + ..., so the sum from s=2 is p - 1.

Similarly, q is the sum from s=1 to infinity of 1/s³, so the sum from s=2 is q - 1.

Therefore, substituting:

\[ (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q \]

Yes, that seems correct. So, the double sum simplifies to p - q.

But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the original double sum and trying to manipulate it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the double sum as:

\[ \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \]

And then, consider changing variables. Let me set n = j + k. Then, for each fixed n, j can range from 1 to n - 1, and k is n - j.

So, the sum becomes:

\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n - 1} \frac{1}{n^3} \]

Which is the same as:

\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3} \]

Which is exactly what I had before. So, that confirms the earlier result.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the double sum in terms of p and q by expanding or using known series.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can write 1/(j + k)^3 as an integral. Since 1/n³ can be expressed as an integral from 0 to 1 of x^{n - 1} dx, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use generating functions or something else.

But actually, the approach I took earlier seems straightforward and gives p - q. Let me see if that makes sense.

Given that p is the sum of reciprocals of squares, and q is the sum of reciprocals of cubes, so p is larger than q because the terms 1/n² are larger than 1/n³ for n ≥ 2.

Therefore, p - q should be a positive number, which makes sense because the original double sum is positive.

Let me compute p - q numerically to see if it's a reasonable number.

We know p = π²/6 ≈ 1.644934

And q ≈ 1.2020569

So, p - q ≈ 1.644934 - 1.2020569 ≈ 0.442877

Now, let me compute the original double sum numerically to see if it's approximately 0.442877.

But computing the double sum directly is difficult, but maybe I can compute it for a few terms and see.

Compute the sum up to j=2 and k=2:

For s=2: (1,1) gives 1/(2)^3 = 1/8 = 0.125

s=3: (1,2), (2,1) gives 2*(1/27) ≈ 0.07407

Total ≈ 0.387301 + 0.002915 ≈ 0.390216

s=19: 18*(1/6859) ≈ 0.00262

Total ≈ 0.390216 + 0.00262 ≈ 0.392836

s=20: 19*(1/8000) = 0.002375

Total ≈ 0.392836 + 0.002375 ≈ 0.395211

So, up to s=20, the total is approximately 0.395211.

But earlier, we had p - q ≈ 0.442877. So, the partial sum up to s=20 is about 0.395, which is approaching 0.442877 but hasn't reached it yet. So, it's converging, but slowly.

Given that, I think the analytical result p - q is correct because the partial sums are approaching that value.

Therefore, I can conclude that the double sum is equal to p - q.

Wait, just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using integral representations or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the double sum as:

\[ \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \int_0^1 x^{j + k - 1} dx \]

Because 1/(j + k)^3 can be written as the integral from 0 to 1 of x^{j + k - 1} dx multiplied by (j + k)^2, but wait, actually, that's not correct.

Wait, the integral representation of 1/n³ is ∫₀¹ x^{n - 1} dx multiplied by something? Let me recall that ∫₀¹ x^{n - 1} dx = 1/n, so 1/n³ would be ∫₀¹ x^{n - 1} * (1 - x)^2 / 2 dx? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps using the integral representation of 1/n³ as ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ (xy)^{n - 1} dx dy? Wait, no, that's 1/n².

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that 1/n³ = ∫₀¹ x^{n - 1} dx * something

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and it's about infinite series. It mentions two sums, p and q, which are defined as the sum of 1/k² and 1/k³ respectively, starting from k=1 to infinity. Then, it asks me to write another double sum, which is the sum from j=1 to infinity and k=1 to infinity of 1/(j + k)³, in terms of p and q. Hmm, alright, let me try to break this down step by step.

First off, I remember that p is the well-known Basel problem, which equals π²/6, and q is the Riemann zeta function at 3, which doesn't have a simple closed-form like p, but maybe I can handle it with series manipulations.

The double sum we're supposed to evaluate is:

sum_{j=1}^∞ sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(j + k)^3.

So, that's over all positive integers j and k, adding 1/(j + k)^3 each time. Hmm, maybe I can change variables or find a way to express this in terms of p and q.

Let me think: If I set n = j + k, then for each n, how many pairs (j, k) are there such that j + k = n? Well, for j and k starting from 1, n would start from 2, since the smallest j + k can be is 1 + 1 = 2. For each n, j can range from 1 to n - 1, and k = n - j. So, the number of pairs is n - 1.

Therefore, maybe I can rewrite the double sum as a single sum over n, where each term is (n - 1) * 1/n³.

Wait, hold on, let me write that more clearly. So the original double sum can be rewritten as:

sum_{j=1}^∞ sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(j + k)^3 = sum_{n=2}^∞ (n - 1) * 1/n³.

Is that right? Let me verify. For each n starting at 2, the number of ways to write n as j + k with j, k ≥ 1 is n - 1. For each of these (j, k), we have a term 1/n³. So yes, the total contribution for each n is (n - 1)/n³. So we can express the double sum as sum_{n=2}^∞ (n - 1)/n³.

But wait, n starts at 2, but we might as well make substitution for n starting at 1, so let me write it as sum_{n=1}^∞ (n)/ (n + 1)^3, but that doesn't seem helpful immediately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should manipulate the expression (n - 1)/n³ to separate terms or compare them to p and q.

Let me expand (n - 1)/n³:

(n - 1)/n³ = n/n³ - 1/n³ = 1/n² - 1/n³.

So, (n - 1)/n³ = 1/n² - 1/n³. That's a useful decomposition.

Therefore, our double sum:

sum_{n=2}^∞ (n - 1)/n³ = sum_{n=2}^∞ [1/n² - 1/n³] = sum_{n=2}^∞ 1/n² - sum_{n=2}^∞ 1/n³.

But p is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k², which is 1 + sum_{n=2}^∞ 1/n². Similarly, q is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k³, which is 1 + sum_{n=2}^∞ 1/n³. So, our double sum can be expressed as:

[sum_{n=2}^∞ 1/n²] - [sum_{n=2}^∞ 1/n³] = [p - 1] - [q - 1] = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q.

So, that means the double sum is equal to p - q.

Hold on, let me make sure I haven’t made a mistake here. Let me retrace my steps:

1. The original double sum is over j and k starting at 1, so we consider all pairs (j, k), with j and k ≥1.

2. We make a substitution n = j + k, so each n ≥2, and for each n, the number of pairs (j, k) with j + k =n is n -1.

3. Therefore, the original double sum can be written as sum_{n=2}^∞ (n -1)/n³

4. Then, we decompose that term into 1/n² - 1/n³. Yes, because n -1 =1⋅n -1, so (n -1)/n³ = n/n³ -1/n³ =1/n² - 1/n³.

5. Then, the sum becomes sum_{n=2}^∞ [1/n² -1/n³], which equals sum_{n=2}^∞ 1/n² - sum_{n=2}^∞ 1/n³.

6. Now, since p = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k² =1 + sum_{n=2}^∞1/n², so sum_{n=2}^∞1/n² = p -1.

Similarly, q = sum_{k=1}^\infty 1/k³ =1 + sum_{n=2}^\infty1/n³, so sum_{n=2}^\infty1/n³ = q -1.

Substituting back, we have [p -1] - [q -1] = p - q.

So yes, that seems correct. The final result is p - q.

Wait, but just to be 100% sure, maybe I should compute both the original double sum numerically with some approximation and see if it matches p - q.

Well, since p ≈ π²/6 ≈ 1.6449, and q ≈ 1.2020569 (which is Apéry's constant, ζ(3)). So, p - q ≈ 1.6449 - 1.2020569 ≈ 0.44284.

Alternatively, let me compute the double sum approximately. Let's compute several terms:

For n =2: (2 -1)/8 =1/8≈0.125

n=3: 2/27≈0.07407

n=4:3/64≈0.046875

n=5:4/125≈0.032

n=6:5/216≈0.023148

n=7:6/343≈0.0175

n=8:7/512≈0.01367

n=9:8/729≈0.01097

n=10:9/1000=0.009

Adding these up:

0.125 +0.07407≈0.19907

+0.046875≈0.245945

+0.032≈0.277945

+0.023148≈0.301093

+0.0175≈0.318593

+0.01367≈0.332263

+0.01097≈0.34323

+0.009≈0.35223

Continuing up to, say, n=20:

Each term gets smaller, let's say up to n=20 perhaps.

It would take time, but let's see n=11 to n=20. n=11:10/1331≈0.00751

n=12:11/1728≈0.00635

n=13:12/2197≈0.00546

n=14:13/2744≈0.00473

n=15:14/3375≈0.00414

n=16:15/4096≈0.00366

n=17:16/4913≈0.00326

n=18:17/5832≈0.002915

n=19:18/6859≈0.00262

n=20:19/8000≈0.002375

Adding these:

0.35223 +0.00751≈0.35974

+0.00635≈0.36609

+0.00546≈0.37155

+0.00473≈0.37628

+0.00414≈0.38042

+0.00366≈0.38408

+0.00326≈0.38734

+0.002915≈0.390255

+0.00262≈0.392875

+0.002375≈0.39525

So, about 0.39525 after n=20. The actual sum continues, but the terms keep getting smaller, so let's see how much we have:

Approximate sum from n=2 to n=20≈0.395.

But p - q was approximately 0.44284. So this approximation up to n=20 is 0.395, and we can see that if we add more terms, the total will approach around 0.4428. Which is less because each term (n -1)/n³ is decreasing towards zero.

But it seems plausible.

Alternatively, let's consider that the exact expression from n=2 to infinity of (n -1)/n³ is indeed p - 1 - q +1= p - q.

Wait, or is it?

Wait, the original substitution: n = j +k starting from n=2. So, number of terms (j,k) with j + k=n is n-1. So, the double sum equals sum_{n=2}^∞ (n-1)/n³= sum_{n=2}∞ (1/n² -1/n³)= [sum_{n=2}∞ 1/n²] - [sum_{n=2} ∞1/n³]= (p -1) - (q -1))= p - q.

So, yes, the conclusion is that the sum is p - q, which is 0.4428 approximately.

Therefore, given that p and q are defined as the sums of reciprocals of the squares and cubes respectively, then yes, sum_{j,k=1}^∞ 1/(j +k)^3= p - q.

I think that makes sense, but just to be thorough, let me check another way of approaching the problem.

Perhaps instead of changing variables, we can try to write the double sum as sum_{j=1}^∞ sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(j + k)^3, which is symmetric in j and k. Maybe we can change variables for each variable.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write j + k = n, as above, but for each j and k, even in separate expressions. Alternatively, I could sum over j or over k first.

Wait, another idea: Since the sum is symmetric over j and k, perhaps we can express it as square of a single sum minus something, but I think that's not going to help here.

Alternatively, we can think in terms of convolutions of series. Since 1/(j +k)^3 can be thought of as the convolution of 1/j^2 and 1/k^2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, hold on, definitions:

Convolutions for generating functions often are about multiplying, but here maybe we can think of rearrangement.

But perhaps that complicates.

Alternatively, perhaps we can integrate or differentiate.

Wait, differentiation might complicate, because when we have 1/(j +k)^3, which is similar to integrating 1/(j +k)^2.

But I'm not sure of an immediate approach.

Wait, perhaps consider that 1/(j + k)^3 = integral from 0 to 1 of t^{j + k -1} ( -ln t )^2 / 2!.

Wait, where did I get that from? Hmm.

I recall that 1/(n)^s can be expressed as the integral from 0 to 1 of t^{n -1} (-ln t)^{s -1}/(s -1)! dt, for Re(s)>1.

Yes, that formula might be handy here.

So, specifically, if s=3, then 1/(n)^3= 1/2! integral_{0}^1 t^{n -1} (-ln t)^2 dt.

So, applying that to our case, 1/(j +k)^3=1/2! integral_{0}^1 t^{(j +k) -1} (-ln t)^2 dt.

Therefore, the double sum can be written as:

sum_{j=1}^infty
