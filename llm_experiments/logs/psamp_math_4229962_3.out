Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$
 

Alright, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, okay. I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. 

First, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). I think the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, r = sqrt(x² + y²). And for θ, I believe it's the arctangent of y over x, so θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, I also remember that sometimes arctan(y/x) isn't enough because it doesn't account for the correct quadrant, so I have to consider the signs of x and y to determine the correct angle.

Okay, so let's apply this to the point (0,3). Here, x is 0 and y is 3. Let me plug these into the formula for r first. So, r = sqrt(0² + 3²) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. That seems straightforward. So, r is 3.

Now, moving on to θ. Since x is 0 and y is 3, let's plug these into θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, if x is 0, then arctan(y/x) becomes arctan(3/0). Hmm, 3 divided by 0 is undefined, right? So, I can't just compute that. I need to think about what happens when x is 0.

I remember that when x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. In this case, since y is positive (3), the point is on the positive y-axis. So, the angle θ should be the angle made with the positive x-axis going counterclockwise to the point. Since it's on the positive y-axis, that should be 90 degrees or π/2 radians.

Let me verify that. If θ is π/2, then in rectangular coordinates, that would be (r*cos(θ), r*sin(θ)) = (3*cos(π/2), 3*sin(π/2)) = (3*0, 3*1) = (0,3), which matches our original point. So, that seems correct.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think about the quadrants. The point (0,3) is on the y-axis, so it's in the first quadrant? Wait, no, actually, the first quadrant is where both x and y are positive, but the y-axis is the boundary between the first and second quadrants. So, technically, it's on the axis, not in a quadrant. But for polar coordinates, when the point is on the axis, θ is just the angle that corresponds to that axis.

So, for the positive y-axis, θ is π/2, and for the negative y-axis, it's 3π/2. Since our point is (0,3), which is on the positive y-axis, θ is π/2. 

Wait, but sometimes I get confused about whether θ is measured from the x-axis or the y-axis. No, θ is always measured from the positive x-axis, going counterclockwise. So, for the positive y-axis, it's a quarter turn, which is π/2 radians. That makes sense.

Let me also recall that in polar coordinates, θ is allowed to be between 0 and 2π, so π/2 is within that range. So, that's good.

Just to recap, for the point (0,3):

1. Calculate r: sqrt(0² + 3²) = 3.
2. Determine θ: Since x is 0 and y is positive, θ is π/2.

Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes, let me think about another way to approach this. Maybe using the unit circle? Hmm, the unit circle has a radius of 1, but in this case, our radius is 3. So, scaling up the unit circle by a factor of 3, the angle should remain the same. So, if on the unit circle, (0,1) corresponds to θ = π/2, then scaling it by 3, we get (0,3) with θ still π/2. That seems consistent.

Alternatively, I can think about the direction of the point. Since it's straight up along the y-axis, it's 90 degrees from the positive x-axis, which is π/2 radians. So, that also aligns with what I found earlier.

Is there another way to check this? Maybe by converting back from polar to rectangular coordinates. If I take r = 3 and θ = π/2, then x = r*cos(θ) = 3*cos(π/2) = 3*0 = 0, and y = r*sin(θ) = 3*sin(π/2) = 3*1 = 3. So, that gives me (0,3), which is exactly the point I started with. So, that confirms that my conversion is correct.

I think I'm confident now that (0,3) in rectangular coordinates is (3, π/2) in polar coordinates.

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinate \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\). 

First, we calculate \(r\) using the formula:
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
For the point \((0, 3)\):
\[ r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{0 + 9} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]

Next, we determine \(\theta\). Since \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\) is positive, the point lies on the positive \(y\)-axis. The angle \(\theta\) for this position is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

Thus, the polar coordinates are:
\[ (r, \theta) = (3, \frac{\pi}{2}) \]

To verify, we convert back from polar to rectangular coordinates:
\[ x = r \cos(\theta) = 3 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 3 \cdot 0 = 0 \]
\[ y = r \sin(\theta) = 3 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \]

This confirms the conversion is correct.

The polar coordinates are \(\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}\).

**Note**: You may need to use the arctangent function in terms of $y$ and $x$ to find the correct angle.

To solve this problem, I first need to recall how to convert rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). Remembering that polar coordinates represent a point based on its distance from the origin (r) and the angle (θ) it makes with the positive x-axis.

So, starting with the rectangular coordinates (0, 3). Hmm, since the x-coordinate is 0, this point lies somewhere on the y-axis. That should simplify things a bit because points on the y-axis have specific properties in polar coordinates.

To find the distance r from the origin to the point (0, 3), I can use the formula:

$$
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

Plugging in the given values:

$$
r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{0 + 9} = \sqrt{9} = 3
$$

So, the radius r is 3. That's straightforward.

Next, I need to find the angle θ. I remember that θ can be found using the arctangent function, more specifically:

$$
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$$

But wait, that formula \(\arctan(y/x)\) is straightforward when x ≠ 0. However, in this case, x is 0, which means dividing by zero. Hmm, that's undefined. I need to think about this carefully.

Since x = 0, we can recall that the point lies on the y-axis. When x is 0, the angle θ is either perpendicular upwards or downwards from the positive x-axis. In the case where y is positive, as it is here (y=3), the angle θ should be 90 degrees or π radians from the positive x-axis.

But to confirm, let me think about the unit circle. The point (0, 3) is straight up on the y-axis, which corresponds to an angle of π/2 radians (or 90 degrees) from the positive x-axis in the counterclockwise direction.

Wait, earlier I thought θ would be π radians, which is 180 degrees. But that's along the negative y-axis, not the positive. So, for the point (0, 3), which is on the positive y-axis, it should be π/2 radians.

Let me confirm this with the standard method. The arctangent of y/x when x and y are both positive is simple, but x = 0 complicates things. So in this special case, we can remember that:

- When x = 0 and y > 0, then θ = π/2.
- When x = 0 and y < 0, then θ = 3π/2.

So in our case, since y = 3 is positive, θ is π/2.

Alternatively, I could think about the unit circle and where the point (0, 3) is. On the unit circle, the point (0,1) corresponds to θ = π/2. Scaling that up to (0,3), it doesn't affect θ; it's just farther away, but direction remains the same.

Therefore, putting it all together, r is 3, and θ is π/2.

Wait a second, let me recall if there's a different way to calculate θ when x is 0. Sometimes, some people might think of the angle differently, but in this case, since x is 0, the angle will be perpendicular to the x-axis. Since y is positive, we're on the positive y-axis, which is π/2.

Is there a chance that θ could be 3π/2? That point (0, -3) is at 3π/2, but we have (0, 3). So, definitely, θ is π/2.

So, combining this with the radius we found earlier, the polar coordinates would be (3, π/2). Wait, but just to make sure, let's recall that in polar coordinates, θ can also be represented in different ways by adding multiples of 2π, but since we're required to have θ between 0 and 2π, π/2 is within that range.

Alternatively, I could plot the point (0, 3) on graph paper. Starting from the origin, moving up 3 units along the y-axis, that's exactly where (0, 3) is. That definitely seems to be on the positive y-axis, so an angle of π/2 makes sense.

But just to recap the steps in case I might have missed something:

1. Find r:
   - r = sqrt(x² + y²)
   - Here it's 0² + 3², which is 9, sqrt(9) is 3. So, r = 3.

2. Find θ:
   - θ = arctan(y / x)
   - But x is 0, so standard formula isn't applicable.
   - Since y is positive, θ is π/2.

So, that all lines up. Just to rule out another possibility, suppose if mistakenly θ was taken as 0 or π or something else. But, for a point on the y-axis with positive y, 0 would correspond to (3, 0), which is on the positive x-axis. π would correspond to (something, 0), on the negative x-axis, right? So yeah, it's π/2.

Let me just visualize it in my mind: origin to (0,3) is along the y-axis, up, and that forms a right angle from the positive x-axis. So, yes, that's π/2. So, it all makes sense.

So, the final polar coordinate is (3, π/2). That should be the answer.

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2})}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinates \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we start by finding the radius \(r\):

\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Since the point \((0, 3)\) lies on the positive y-axis, the angle \(\theta\) is \(\pi/2\). This is because points on the positive y-axis correspond to an angle of \(\pi/2\) radians from the positive x-axis.

Thus, the polar coordinates are \(\boxed{(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2})}\).

Alright, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, okay. I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. 

First, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). I think the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, r = √(x² + y²). And for θ, I believe it's the arctangent of y over x, so θ = arctan(y/x). 

Wait, but in this case, the x-coordinate is 0. So, plugging that into the formula for θ, we get θ = arctan(y/0). Hmm, arctan of something over 0. I remember that dividing by zero is undefined, but in terms of limits, as x approaches 0 from the positive side, arctan(y/x) approaches π/2, and from the negative side, it approaches -π/2. But since y is positive here (y is 3), and x is 0, I think θ should be π/2 radians. 

But let me make sure. So, if x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis. In polar coordinates, that corresponds to an angle of π/2. If x were 0 and y were negative, it would be 3π/2. So, yeah, θ should be π/2. 

Now, let's calculate r. Since x is 0 and y is 3, plugging into the formula for r: r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3. That seems straightforward. 

So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates should be (3, π/2). 

Wait, just to double-check, let me visualize the point (0,3) on the rectangular coordinate system. It's located on the y-axis, 3 units above the origin. In polar coordinates, that should correspond to a radius of 3 and an angle of π/2, which is straight up along the y-axis. That makes sense. 

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the unit circle. On the unit circle, the point (0,1) corresponds to an angle of π/2. Since our point is (0,3), it's just three times as far from the origin, so the radius is 3, and the angle remains π/2. 

I think that's solid. So, yeah, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). 

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.

To convert the rectangular coordinate \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for \(r\) and \(\theta\).

Substituting \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\):
\[
r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Next, we determine \(\theta\). Since \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\) is on the positive \(y\)-axis, the angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).

Thus, the polar coordinates are:
\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}

\[p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.\]Find a way to write
\[\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$
 

Alright, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find a way to express a double infinite sum in terms of two known constants, p and q. Let me write down what I have:

First, they define:
\[ p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \]
and
\[ q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \]

Then, the problem asks me to find a way to write:
\[ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \]
in terms of p and q.

Hmm, okay. So I need to manipulate this double sum somehow to relate it to p and q. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that double sums can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can find a way to change variables or find a clever way to express this sum in terms of single sums or products of sums.

Let me write out the double sum more explicitly to see if I can spot a pattern or a way to reindex it.

So, the double sum is:
\[ \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \]

Let me consider substituting a new variable, say, n = j + k. Then, for each fixed n, j can range from 1 to n - 1, and k = n - j. So, for each n, j goes from 1 to n - 1, and k is determined accordingly.

Wait, but in the original sum, both j and k start at 1 and go to infinity. So, if I fix n = j + k, then n can range from 2 to infinity, since the smallest j and k are 1, so n = 2 is the minimum, and it goes up from there.

So, maybe I can rewrite the double sum as a single sum over n, with each term being the sum over j of 1/(n)^3, where j ranges such that k = n - j is also at least 1.

Let me try that.

So, the double sum becomes:
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3} \]

Because for each n, j can go from 1 to n - 1, and k = n - j, which is at least 1 because j is at most n - 1.

So, simplifying that, the inner sum is just adding 1/n^3 (n - 1) times, since j goes from 1 to n - 1. Therefore, the inner sum is (n - 1)/n^3.

Therefore, the entire double sum becomes:
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3} \]

Simplify that expression: (n - 1)/n^3 = (n/n^3) - (1/n^3) = 1/n^2 - 1/n^3.

So, the double sum is:
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right) \]

Which can be split into two separate sums:
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} \]

Now, I can express these sums in terms of p and q, since p is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n^2, and q is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n^3.

So, let's write:
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - \frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1 \]
Similarly,
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - \frac{1}{1^3} = q - 1 \]

Therefore, substituting back into the expression for the double sum:
\[ (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q \]

Wait, so does that mean the double sum is equal to p - q?

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I started with the double sum over j and k of 1/(j + k)^3.

2. I substituted n = j + k, so n goes from 2 to infinity.

3. For each n, j goes from 1 to n - 1, so the inner sum is over (n - 1) terms, each 1/n^3.

4. Therefore, the inner sum is (n - 1)/n^3, which simplifies to 1/n^2 - 1/n^3.

5. Then, the double sum becomes the sum from n=2 to infinity of (1/n^2 - 1/n^3).

6. Splitting that into two sums: sum_{n=2}^\infty 1/n^2 - sum_{n=2}^\infty 1/n^3.

7. Recognizing that sum_{n=2}^\infty 1/n^2 = p - 1, since p is the sum starting at n=1.

8. Similarly, sum_{n=2}^\infty 1/n^3 = q - 1.

9. Therefore, the double sum is (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.

That seems correct. Let me see if I can think of another way to approach this, just to verify.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the double sum as a convolution or use generating functions or something. But I think the substitution method I used is straightforward and correct.

Another way to think about it is to notice that the double sum is symmetric in j and k, so perhaps there's a way to relate it to p and q through some manipulation.

But in this case, the substitution method worked out nicely, so I think the answer is indeed p - q.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me compute the first few terms of the original double sum and see if it matches with p - q.

Compute the original double sum:

For j=1, k=1: 1/(1+1)^3 = 1/8

j=1, k=2: 1/27

j=2, k=1: 1/27

j=1, k=3: 1/64

j=2, k=2: 1/125

j=3, k=1: 1/64

And so on.

So, the terms are symmetric across j and k, so each pair (j,k) and (k,j) contribute the same amount. So, except when j=k, but actually, no, in this case, each term is 1/(j + k)^3, so it's symmetric in j and k.

So, for n=2: j=1, k=1: 1/8

n=3: j=1, k=2 and j=2, k=1: 2*(1/27)

n=4: j=1, k=3; j=2, k=2; j=3, k=1: 3*(1/64)

Wait, no, actually, for n=4, j can be 1,2,3, so k=3,2,1 respectively, so three terms, each 1/64.

Wait, but in the original double sum, each term is 1/(j + k)^3, so for each n, the number of terms is n - 1, each contributing 1/n^3.

So, the double sum is equal to sum_{n=2}^\infty (n - 1)/n^3, which is what I had before.

So, for n=2: 1 term, 1/8

n=3: 2 terms, each 1/27, so total 2/27

n=4: 3 terms, each 1/64, so total 3/64

n=5: 4 terms, each 1/125, so total 4/125

And so on.

So, the double sum is 1/8 + 2/27 + 3/64 + 4/125 + ... etc.

Now, let's compute p and q.

p is sum_{k=1}^\infty 1/k^2 = pi^2/6 ≈ 1.6449

q is sum_{k=1}^\infty 1/k^3 = Apery's constant ≈ 1.2020569

So, p - q ≈ 1.6449 - 1.2020569 ≈ 0.44284

Now, let's compute the first few terms of the double sum:

1/8 = 0.125

2/27 ≈ 0.074074

3/64 ≈ 0.046875

4/125 = 0.032

5/216 ≈ 0.023148

6/343 ≈ 0.0175

7/512 ≈ 0.01367

8/729 ≈ 0.01097

9/1000 = 0.009

Adding these up:

0.125 + 0.074074 ≈ 0.199074

+ 0.046875 ≈ 0.245949

+ 0.032 ≈ 0.277949

+ 0.023148 ≈ 0.301097

+ 0.0175 ≈ 0.318597

+ 0.01367 ≈ 0.332267

+ 0.01097 ≈ 0.343237

+ 0.009 ≈ 0.352237

So, after 9 terms, the sum is approximately 0.352237.

But p - q is approximately 0.44284, so the partial sums are approaching that value, but slowly.

So, as n increases, the terms (n - 1)/n^3 behave like 1/n^2, so the series converges, and the sum is indeed p - q.

Therefore, I think my earlier conclusion is correct: the double sum is equal to p - q.

So, in conclusion, the sum is p - q.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{p - q}
</think>

We start with the definitions:
\[ p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}. \]

We need to find a way to express the double sum:
\[ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \]
in terms of \( p \) and \( q \).

First, we substitute a new variable \( n = j + k \). For each fixed \( n \), \( j \) ranges from 1 to \( n - 1 \), and \( k = n - j \). Thus, the double sum can be rewritten as:
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3}. \]

The inner sum is:
\[ \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{n - 1}{n^3}. \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3}. \]

Thus, the double sum becomes:
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right). \]

We split this into two separate sums:
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}. \]

Recognizing these sums in terms of \( p \) and \( q \):
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 \]
and
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1. \]

Therefore, the double sum is:
\[ (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q. \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{p - q} \]

**Problem:** Compute \( S = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \) and express it in terms of \( p \) and \( q \).

**Push comes to shove:** I need to compute \( S = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \) and write it in terms of \( p \) and \( q \).

I remember that sometimes double sums can be tackled by changing variables or using known series. I also recall that the double sum of \( 1/(j+k) \) can be tricky, but adding higher powers might have some properties we can exploit.

First, let's define \( p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \) and \( q = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \). These are known values, with \( p = \pi^2/6 \) and \( q = \zeta(3) \), but I don't know if that knowledge is necessary here since the problem just defines \( p \) and \( q \).

The target sum is \( S = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \). I wonder if I can manipulate this somehow. Maybe by changing the order of summation or substituting variables.

Let me consider changing variables. Let \( n = j + k \). Then, for each fixed \( n \), how many pairs \( (j, k) \) satisfy \( j + k = n \)? That's \( n - 1 \) because \( j \) can run from 1 to \( n -1 \) (with \( k = n - j \)).

So, maybe rewriting the double sum as a single sum over \( n \):

\[
S = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3} 
\]

Wait, so for each \( n \geq 2 \), there are \( n - 1 \) terms of \( 1/n^3 \). Therefore, it's \( \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n -1}{n^3} \).

Simplify that:

\[
S = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n -1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \left( \frac{n}{n^3} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right) = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

Which is:

\[
S = \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - 1 \right) - \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} - 1 \right)
\]

So that becomes:

\[
S = \left( p - 1 \right) - \left( q - 1 \right) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q
\]

Therefore, \( S = p - q \), so expressed in terms of \( p \) and \( q \), the sum is \( p - q \).

Wait a second. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Introduced substitution \( n = j + k \). So for each \( n \geq 2 \), pairs \( (j, k) \) start from \( j = 1, k = n -1 \) up to \( j = n -1, k =1 \). Therefore, for each \( n \geq 2 \), there are \( n -1 \) terms.

2. Therefore, the double sum can be expressed as \( \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} (n -1) \times \frac{1}{n^3} \). That part seems correct.

3. Breaking it down step by step:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n -1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

Which is correct.

4. Expressing the sums starting at \( n=1 \):

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - 1 = p -1
\]
Similarly,
\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q -1
\]
Thus,

\[
S = (p -1) - (q -1) = p -1 - q +1 = p - q
\]

So this all adds up correctly.

Therefore, the sum \( S \) is simply \( p - q \).

I think that makes sense. Let me think if there's another way this could be done just to double-check.

Alternatively, consider writing the double sum as:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}
\]

If I fix \( j \), then for each \( j \) the sum over \( k \) becomes:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{m=j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3}
\]

Where I substituted \( m = j + k \), so \( k = m - j \), which means when \( k \geq1 \), \( m \geq j +1 \). Therefore, the sum over \( k \) is just the tail of the \( p \) series starting at \( m = j +1 \).

Therefore, the total sum \( S \) can be written as:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{m=j+1}^\infty \frac{1}{m^3} = \sum_{m=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{m -1} \frac{1}{m^3}
\]

Which is similar to before. Thus,

\[
\sum_{m=2}^\infty \frac{m -1}{m^3} = \sum_{m=2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{m^3} \right ) = (p -1) - (q -1) = p - q
\]

Same result. That gives me more confidence.

So I think regardless of the method, the result is \( S = p - q \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{p - q}
</think>

To solve the given problem, we start by defining the sums \( p \) and \( q \):

\[
p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.
\]

We need to find a way to express the double sum

\[
S = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}
\]

in terms of \( p \) and \( q \).

First, we change variables by setting \( n = j + k \). For each fixed \( n \), the number of pairs \((j, k)\) such that \( j + k = n \) is \( n - 1 \). Thus, we can rewrite the double sum as a single sum:

\[
S = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
S = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3}.
\]

We can break this down further:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right).
\]

This separates into two sums:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}.
\]

Expressing these sums in terms of \( p \) and \( q \), we have:

\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1.
\]

Thus, the sum \( S \) becomes:

\[
S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q.
\]

Therefore, the sum \( S \) is:

\[
\boxed{p - q}
\]
