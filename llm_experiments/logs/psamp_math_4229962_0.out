Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$
 

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. 

First, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). I think the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, r = √(x² + y²). And for θ, I believe it's the arctangent of y over x, which is θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, I also remember that sometimes arctan(y/x) doesn't give the correct angle because it depends on the quadrant where the point is located. So, I need to be careful about that.

Alright, let's apply this to the point (0, 3). So, x is 0 and y is 3. Let me compute r first. Plugging into the formula, r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That makes sense because the point is 3 units above the origin on the y-axis, so the distance from the origin is indeed 3.

Now, onto θ. Since x is 0, I can't use θ = arctan(y/x) because that would involve dividing by zero, which is undefined. Hmm, so I need another way to find θ. I remember that when x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. In this case, since y is positive (3), the point is on the positive y-axis. 

In polar coordinates, the angle θ is measured from the positive x-axis going counterclockwise. So, if the point is on the positive y-axis, the angle should be 90 degrees, or π/2 radians. Let me confirm that. If I think about the unit circle, the point (0, 1) corresponds to an angle of π/2. Since our point is (0, 3), which is just 3 times that, the angle should still be π/2 because it's still on the same line, just further out.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, when both x and y are zero, it's undefined, but in this case, x is zero and y is positive, so it's on the y-axis. So, θ should be π/2. 

Let me also recall that in some cases, when x is zero, θ can be either π/2 or 3π/2, depending on whether y is positive or negative. Since y is positive here, it's π/2. If y were negative, it would be 3π/2. So, that seems right.

Just to double-check, let's think about the conversion formulas again. For a point (x, y), polar coordinates are (r, θ) where r = √(x² + y²) and θ = arctan(y/x). But when x is zero, arctan(y/x) is undefined, so we have to consider the quadrant. Since x is zero and y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the angle whose tangent is y/x. But since x is zero, the tangent is undefined, but we know that when x approaches zero from the positive side, the angle approaches π/2. Similarly, when x approaches zero from the negative side, the angle approaches 3π/2. But since x is exactly zero, and y is positive, it's π/2.

Let me also consider another approach. If I have the point (0, 3), plotting it on the coordinate system, it's straight up along the y-axis. So, the angle from the positive x-axis to this point is a right angle, which is π/2 radians. That seems consistent.

Another way to think about it is using the unit circle. The unit circle has points (cos θ, sin θ). So, if I have a point (0, 3), that's 3 times the unit vector pointing straight up. So, the angle θ is still π/2 because scaling doesn't change the angle, only the radius. So, even though r is 3, θ remains π/2.

Wait, just to make sure, let me recall that in polar coordinates, θ is determined by the direction from the origin to the point, regardless of the distance. So, even if the point is further away, the angle is still the same. So, if it's on the positive y-axis, θ is π/2, regardless of whether it's (0,1) or (0,3). That makes sense.

Let me also think about the conversion formulas in terms of sine and cosine. In polar coordinates, x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. So, if I have x = 0 and y = 3, then 0 = r cos θ and 3 = r sin θ. Since r is positive, we can divide these equations. So, dividing y by x, we get (r sin θ)/(r cos θ) = tan θ. But x is zero, so tan θ is undefined, which again tells us that θ is π/2 or 3π/2. But since y is positive, it's π/2.

Alternatively, if I look at x = r cos θ, and x is zero, then cos θ must be zero. The cosine of θ is zero at θ = π/2 and θ = 3π/2. Then, looking at y = r sin θ, which is 3. Since sin θ is positive when θ is π/2 and negative when θ is 3π/2. Since y is positive, θ must be π/2. That also confirms it.

So, putting it all together, r is 3 and θ is π/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me visualize it again. The point (0,3) is three units up the y-axis. So, from the origin, if I go straight up three units, that's the point. The angle from the positive x-axis to this point is a right angle, which is π/2 radians. So, yeah, that seems correct.

I think I've covered all the bases here. I considered the formulas, thought about the quadrants, checked using sine and cosine, and even plotted it mentally. Everything points to θ being π/2. So, I'm confident that the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinate \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\). 

First, we calculate \(r\) using the formula:
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]
For the point \((0, 3)\):
\[ r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]

Next, we determine \(\theta\). Since \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\), the point lies on the positive \(y\)-axis. The angle \(\theta\) for points on the positive \(y\)-axis is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

Thus, the polar coordinates are:
\[ (r, \theta) = \left(3, \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \]

\[
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
\]

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the radius or the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. Right?

Let me recall the formulas for converting from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, θ). I think the formulas are:

r = √(x² + y²)

and

θ = arctan(y/x)

But wait, arctan(y/x) might not always give the correct angle, right? Because depending on the quadrant, the angle could be in a different position. But in this case, since the x-coordinate is 0 and the y-coordinate is 3, I need to be careful.

First, let me compute r.

Given the point (0, 3), so x is 0, y is 3.

Plugging into the formula for r:

r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3.

So, r is 3, which makes sense because the point is 3 units away from the origin.

Now, moving on to θ.

θ = arctan(y/x) = arctan(3/0).

Hmm, dividing by zero is undefined. So what's the arctan of a number divided by zero?

I remember that when x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. Since y is positive, in rectangular coordinates, that would place the point in the positive y-axis, which is at the top of the coordinate system.

In polar coordinates, points on the positive y-axis correspond to an angle of π/2 radians. Because starting from the positive x-axis, rotating counterclockwise by 90 degrees (which is π/2 radians) brings us to the positive y-axis.

So, in this case, θ should be π/2.

Wait, let me think again. If I use arctan(y/x), and x is 0, why don't I have to worry about the quadrant? Normally, points with x=0 either have θ = π/2 or θ = 3π/2, depending on whether y is positive or negative.

Right, because if it's on the positive y-axis, θ is π/2, and on the negative y-axis, θ is 3π/2. So since our point is (0, 3), it's definitely on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2.

Therefore, the polar coordinates should be (3, π/2).

But wait, just to double-check. Sometimes, I remember that when both x and y are zero, the angle is undefined, but in cases where only one is zero, θ is as I had thought.

So, (0,3):

- r is distance from origin, which is 3.

- θ is angle of 90 degrees or π/2 radians from positive x-axis.

So, yeah, (3, π/2).

Let me verify. In polar coordinates, if I convert back to rectangular, does it produce (0,3)?

Given r = 3, θ = π/2.

Converting back:

x = r cos θ = 3 cos(π/2)

cos(π/2) is 0, so x = 0.

y = r sin θ = 3 sin(π/2)

sin(π/2) is 1, so y = 3.

Hence, it becomes (0,3), which is correct.

So yes, my answer (3, π/2) is correct.

Alternatively, I can think about the coordinate plane. The point (0,3) is three units above the origin on the y-axis. So starting from the origin, we move along the y-axis by 3 units. Therefore, the radius (distance) is 3, and the angle is a right angle from the positive x-axis.

Therefore, θ is indeed π/2.

Just to make sure, is there a different representation with a negative radius? Wait, sometimes in polar coordinates, if r is allowed to be negative, θ can be adjusted by π. But in this case, the instruction says r > 0, so we don't need to worry about that. So (3, π/2) is the correct answer.

Additionally, just recalling some standard polar coordinates, π/2 is commonly associated with the positive y-axis, just to think about common angles like 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, etc.

So for 0 radians, it's along the positive x-axis. π/2 is up the positive y-axis, π is along the negative x-axis, and 3π/2 is down the negative y-axis.

Therefore, (3, π/2) is the point (0,3).

Wait, another thought—some systems might switch between radians and degrees, but since the problem doesn't specify, I can assume radians, as most higher-level math uses radians.

Alternatively, if in degrees, π/2 is 90 degrees, but the answer expects it in terms of multiples of pi.

Therefore, to keep it consistent, (3, π/2) is correct.

I think I'm confident about this.

**Final Answer**

The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2})}.

To convert the rectangular coordinate \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we need to find the values \(r\) and \(\theta\).

First, we calculate \(r\) using the formula:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
For the point \((0, 3)\):
\[
r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{0 + 9} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Next, we determine \(\theta\). Since the point \((0, 3)\) lies on the positive \(y\)-axis, the angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).

Thus, the polar coordinates are:
\[
\boxed{\left(3, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}

Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. 

First, let me recall the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). I think r is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, so r = sqrt(x² + y²). And θ is found using the arctangent function, θ = arctan(y/x). But wait, I also remember that sometimes arctan(y/x) isn't enough because it doesn't account for the correct quadrant. So I need to consider the signs of x and y to determine the correct angle.

Alright, let's apply this to the point (0, 3). So x is 0 and y is 3. Let me compute r first. Plugging into the formula, r = sqrt(0² + 3²) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That makes sense because the point is 3 units above the origin on the y-axis, so the distance from the origin is indeed 3.

Now, onto θ. Since x is 0, I need to think about what θ would be. The arctangent function, arctan(y/x), would be arctan(3/0). But wait, division by zero is undefined. Hmm, so I can't use that formula directly here. I need to figure out θ based on the location of the point.

Looking at the point (0, 3), it's on the positive y-axis. In polar coordinates, when a point is on the positive y-axis, the angle θ is π/2 radians. Because starting from the positive x-axis, we rotate π/2 radians counterclockwise to reach the positive y-axis. So, θ should be π/2.

But just to be thorough, let me think about the quadrants. The point (0, 3) is in the first quadrant because both x and y are positive. Wait, actually, when x is 0, it's on the axis, not strictly in a quadrant. But regardless, for points on the axes, the angle is either 0, π/2, π, or 3π/2. Since y is positive, it's π/2.

So putting it all together, r is 3 and θ is π/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

Wait, let me double-check. If I convert back to rectangular coordinates, does it give me (0, 3)? The conversion formulas are x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. So plugging in r = 3 and θ = π/2, x = 3 cos(π/2) and y = 3 sin(π/2). Cos(π/2) is 0 and sin(π/2) is 1, so x = 0 and y = 3. Perfect, that matches the original point.

So, I think I did that correctly. The point (0, 3) in rectangular coordinates is (3, π/2) in polar coordinates.

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates are \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinate \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) and \(\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\). However, since \(x = 0\) and \(y = 3\), we need to determine \(\theta\) based on the location of the point.

First, calculate \(r\):
\[
r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Next, determine \(\theta\). Since the point \((0, 3)\) is on the positive \(y\)-axis, the angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).

Thus, the polar coordinates are \((3, \frac{\pi}{2})\).

Okay, so I have this problem where I need to express a double infinite sum in terms of two other sums, p and q. Let me write down what I have:

First, p is defined as the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k², which I know is the famous Basel problem and it equals π²/6. Then q is the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k³, which is known as Apéry's constant, approximately 1.2020569... But I don't think I need the numerical value here, just the symbolic representation.

The expression I need to find is the double sum from j=1 to infinity and k=1 to infinity of 1/(j + k)³. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated because it's a double sum, and the denominator is (j + k) cubed. I wonder if there's a way to manipulate this into something involving p and q.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can change variables or find a way to express the double sum in terms of single sums. Sometimes, when dealing with double sums, it helps to fix one variable and sum over the other, then see if that can be expressed in terms of known series.

So, let's denote S as the double sum:

S = Σ_{j=1}^∞ Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(j + k)³

I need to express S in terms of p and q. Let me see if I can manipulate this expression.

First, notice that j and k are both starting from 1, so j + k starts from 2. Maybe I can change variables to n = j + k and m = j or something like that. Let me try to fix n = j + k and see how many terms contribute to each n.

For a fixed n, j can range from 1 to n - 1, because if j is 1, then k is n - 1; if j is 2, k is n - 2, and so on, until j is n - 1, k is 1. So for each n ≥ 2, there are (n - 1) pairs (j, k) such that j + k = n.

Therefore, the double sum S can be rewritten as:

S = Σ_{n=2}^∞ Σ_{j=1}^{n-1} 1/n³

Because for each n, we have (n - 1) terms each equal to 1/n³. So this becomes:

S = Σ_{n=2}^∞ (n - 1)/n³

Simplify that:

S = Σ_{n=2}^∞ (n - 1)/n³ = Σ_{n=2}^∞ (n/n³ - 1/n³) = Σ_{n=2}^∞ (1/n² - 1/n³)

So, that simplifies to:

S = Σ_{n=2}^∞ 1/n² - Σ_{n=2}^∞ 1/n³

But I know that Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n² = p, so Σ_{n=2}^∞ 1/n² = p - 1/1² = p - 1.

Similarly, Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n³ = q, so Σ_{n=2}^∞ 1/n³ = q - 1/1³ = q - 1.

Therefore, substituting back:

S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So S is equal to p - q? Let me verify that.

Let me go through the steps again:

1. Start with S = Σ_{j=1}^∞ Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(j + k)³.

2. Change variables by setting n = j + k. For each n ≥ 2, the number of (j, k) pairs is (n - 1). So, S becomes Σ_{n=2}^∞ (n - 1)/n³.

3. Break that into two sums: Σ_{n=2}^∞ 1/n² - Σ_{n=2}^∞ 1/n³.

4. Recognize that Σ_{n=2}^∞ 1/n² = p - 1 and Σ_{n=2}^∞ 1/n³ = q - 1.

5. Therefore, S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with n=2: For n=2, the term is (2 - 1)/2³ = 1/8. For n=3, it's 2/27, and so on. So, the sum is 1/8 + 2/27 + 3/64 + ... which is indeed (1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ...) - (1/8 + 1/27 + 1/64 + ...). So, yes, that's p - 1 minus q - 1, which is p - q.

Wait, but let me think again. Is p = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/k², so p = 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ... So, Σ_{n=2}^∞ 1/n² = p - 1.

Similarly, q = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/k³ = 1 + 1/8 + 1/27 + 1/64 + ..., so Σ_{n=2}^∞ 1/n³ = q - 1.

Therefore, S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.

So, yes, that seems to hold.

But just to be thorough, let me compute the first few terms and see if it aligns with p - q.

Compute p - q:

p = π²/6 ≈ 1.6449

q ≈ 1.2020569

So, p - q ≈ 1.6449 - 1.2020569 ≈ 0.4428431

Now, compute S manually for a few terms:

For n=2: 1/8 = 0.125

n=3: 2/27 ≈ 0.074074

n=4: 3/64 ≈ 0.046875

n=5: 4/125 ≈ 0.032

n=6: 5/216 ≈ 0.023148

Adding up these terms: 0.125 + 0.074074 ≈ 0.199074; plus 0.046875 ≈ 0.245949; plus 0.032 ≈ 0.277949; plus 0.023148 ≈ 0.301097.

Continuing:

n=7: 6/343 ≈ 0.0175

n=8: 7/512 ≈ 0.013671875

n=9: 8/729 ≈ 0.010973

n=10: 9/1000 = 0.009

Adding these: 0.301097 + 0.0175 ≈ 0.318597; +0.013671875 ≈ 0.332269; +0.010973 ≈ 0.343242; +0.009 ≈ 0.352242.

Continuing up to n=10, we have about 0.352242. Let's see how close that is to p - q ≈ 0.4428431. It's still increasing, but it's clear that the series converges, and the partial sums approach approximately 0.4428.

So, that seems consistent. Thus, I think my conclusion is correct.

Therefore, the double sum S can be expressed as p - q.

**Final Answer**
The sum can be written as \boxed{p - q}.
</think>

We need to express the double infinite sum
\[
\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}
\]
in terms of \( p \) and \( q \), where
\[
p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.
\]

First, we rewrite the double sum by changing variables. Let \( n = j + k \). For each fixed \( n \geq 2 \), the number of pairs \((j, k)\) such that \( j + k = n \) is \( n - 1 \). Thus, the double sum can be expressed as:
\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{n^3}.
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3}.
\]

We can break this into two separate sums:
\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right).
\]

Recognizing these sums, we have:
\[
\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1.
\]

Therefore, the original double sum becomes:
\[
(p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.
\]

Thus, the sum can be written as:
\[
\boxed{p - q}.

\[ p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \]
and
\[ q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \]
And I need to find a way to write the sum:
\[ \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \]
in terms of p and q.

Hmm, okay. So let's break this down step by step.

First, I notice that both p and q are sums of reciprocals of powers of integers. p is the sum of reciprocals squared, which reminds me of the Basel problem, where it's known that:
\[ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \]
But here, p is just defined abstractly, so maybe it's more general.

Similarly, q is the sum of reciprocals cubed, which is related to the Riemann zeta function at 3, though again, here q is just defined as the sum. But since we're supposed to express the original sum in terms of p and q, p and q incorporate these constants.

So, looking back at the sum I have to compute:
\[ S = \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \]
I need to find a way to express this double sum in terms of p and q.

One approach could be to manipulate the sum by substituting variables or perhaps exploiting symmetry or convolution properties. Let me think.

Let's consider fixing the sum n = j + k. Then, for each n, the number of ways to write n as j + k with j, k ≥ 1 is (n - 1) because n can be written as 1 + (n-1), 2 + (n-2), ..., (n-1) + 1.

So, for each n ≥ 2, there are (n - 1) pairs (j, k) such that j + k = n.

Hence, perhaps we can rewrite the double sum S as a single sum over n, multiplied by the number of terms for each n.

Let me write that down:
\[ S = \sum_{n=2}^\infty (n - 1) \cdot \frac{1}{n^3} \]
Because for each n starting from 2, there are (n -1 ) pairs, each contributing 1/n³.

Simplify this:
\[ S = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3} \]
We can split this fraction:
\[ \frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \frac{n}{n^3} - \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \]

So, then the sum S becomes:
\[ S = \sum_{n=2}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{n^3} \right ) \]
Which can be separated into two sums:
\[ S = \left( \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} \right ) - \left( \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} \right ) \]
But both of these sums can be related back to p and q.

Given that:
\[ p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \]
So, the sum from n=2 to ∞ is p - the first term where n=1. The first term is 1/1² = 1, so:
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 \]

Similarly, q is defined as:
\[ q = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3} \]
So, the sum from n=2 to ∞ is q - 1, since the first term is 1/1³ = 1:
\[ \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1 \]

Substituting these back into the expression for S:
\[ S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) \]
Simplify that:
\[ S = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q \]

So, S equals p minus q.

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning.

Starting from the double sum S, we fixed n = j + k, noted that for each n ≥ 2, there are (n - 1) pairs. Hence, S becomes the sum from n=2 to ∞ of (n -1)/n³.

Then, decomposed that fraction into 1/n² - 1/n³, and split the sum into two sums, each from n=2 onwards. But when subtracting, the 1/n³ sum requires q minus 1, while the 1/n² requires p minus 1.

Putting together, subtracting gives p - q. That seems consistent.

Let me verify with another approach, perhaps swap the order of summations or find another manipulation.

Alternatively, since S is a double sum, maybe we can find generating functions or use double series techniques.

Alternatively, try to relate S to known sums.

Let me consider that:

Each term is 1/(j + k)^3. So, is there a way to write this as a convolution?

Yes, 1/(j + k)^3 is like the convolution of 1/k² and 1/k. However, convolution in discrete math is given by:
\[ (f * g)(n) = \sum_{m=0}^n f(m) g(n - m) \]
But in this case, we have 1/(j + k)^3, but the sum is over all j and k, which would be like a two-sided convolution.

But maybe I can use generating functions.

Another approach: If we consider that each term 1/(j + k)^3 is similar to integrating 1/(j + k)^2 multiple times or perhaps taking derivatives.

Wait, however, maybe leveraging the integral representation of reciprocal powers.

But perhaps a better way: Let me recall that integrals often help with sums.

Alternatively, I can try to think in terms of integral transforms.

Alternatively, maybe change variables.

Wait, perhaps writing 1/(j + k)^3 as an integral. Since 1/n³ can be expressed as an integral.

Hmm, let me think:

The integral of t^{n - 1} from 0 to 1 is 1/n. So, for 1/n³, perhaps integrating multiple times.

Indeed,
\[ \frac{1}{n^3} = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 t^{n - 1} u^{n - 1} du dt \]
Wait, not quite, let's do it step by step.

We know that:
\[ \int_0^1 t^{k} dt = \frac{1}{k + 1} \]
Therefore,
\[ \int_0^1 \int_0^1 t^{k} u^{k} dt du = \left( \frac{1}{k + 1} \right )^2 \]
So, to get 1/(k + 1)^3, perhaps I need another integral.

Wait, maybe:

Wait, 1/(k)^3 is equal to the triple integral of t(u*v)^{k -1}, or something like that.

Wait, slightly different. Let me recall that:

In general, for n ≥ 1:
\[ \frac{1}{n^k} = \frac{1}{(k - 1)!} \int_0^1 t^{n - 1} (- \ln t)^{k -1} dt \]

But perhaps that's too complicated.

Alternatively, I can recall that 1/n³ can be represented by:
\[ \int_0^1 \int_0^1 t^{n -1} u^{n -1} du dt \cdot something \]

Wait, perhaps I can represent 1/n³ as an iterated integral:

Yes, according to integral transforms, the Riemann zeta function can be expressed via these integrals.

Actually, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{n^3} = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \int_0^1 t^{n -1} u^{n -1} v^{n -1} du dv dt \]
But integrating over three variables might complicate things.

Alternatively, note that:
\[ \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{1}{2!} \int_0^1 t^{n -1} (-\ln t)^2 dt \]

Yes, that rings a bell. For integer k ≥ 1:
\[ \frac{1}{n^k} = \frac{1}{(k -1)!} \int_0^1 t^{n -1} (-\ln t)^{k -1} dt \]

So, for k = 3, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{1}{2!} \int_0^1 t^{n -1} (-\ln t)^2 dt \]
So, 1/n³ is integral of t^{n -1} times (−ln t)², divided by 2.

Therefore, using this representation, perhaps I can write the double sum S as:

\[ S = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \int_0^1 t^{j + k -1} (-\ln t)^2 du dv \]

Wait, hold on, actually, from the above identity, k =3 comes from 1/n³, so we can write:

1/(j +k )³ = ½ ∫₀¹ t^{j +k -1} (−ln t)² dt

Wait, actually, the identity is:

1/n³ = (1/(2!)) ∫₀¹ t^{n -1} (−ln t)² dt.

So, substituting into S:
\[ S = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 t^{j + k -1} (-\ln t)^2 dt \]
So, S = (1/2) ∫₀¹ (-ln t)^2 dt ∑_{j=1}^∞ ∑_{k=1}^∞ t^{j＋k −1}

Note that ∑_{j=1}^∞ t^{j -1 +k} is same as summing over j and k.

But let me manipulate it:

First, notice that t^{j +k -1} = t^{j -1} * t^{k -1} * t²?

Wait, no, actually, let's see:

Wait, t^{j +k -1} = t^{j -1} * t^{k -1} * t²? No, t^{j +k -1} = t^{j -1} * t^{k -1} * t². Wait, not quite.

Wait, actually, t^{j +k -1} = t^{j -1} * t^{k -1} * t²? Wait, t^{j +k -1} can be rewritten as t^{(j-1)+(k-1)+1} Wait, Let me think. Hmm.

Wait: Perhaps more clearly:

t^{j + k -1} = t^{j -1} * t^{k}?

No, that would be t^{j -1} * t^{k} = t^{j +k -1}, yes.

Hence,
\[ \sum_{j=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty t^{j + k -1} = \sum_{j=1}^\infty t^{j -1} \sum_{k=1}^\infty t^{k} \]
So, ∑_{k=1}^∞ t^{k} is a geometric series which sums to t / (1 - t), for |t| < 1.

Similarly, ∑_{j=1}^\infty t^{j -1} = ∑_{m=0}^\infty t^{m} = 1 / (1 - t)

Hence, multiplying these terms:
\[ \frac{1}{1 - t} \cdot \frac{t}{1 - t} = \frac{t}{(1 - t)^2} \]

Hence, the double sum over j and k of t^{j +k -1} is t / (1 - t)^2.

Therefore, plugging back into S:
\[ S = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 (-\ln t)^2 \cdot \frac{t}{(1 - t)^2} dt \]

So, S = (1/2) ∫₀¹ [ (−ln t)² * t / (1 - t)² ] dt

Hmm, so we now have an integral representation for S. So, the question is whether this integral can be expressed in terms of p and q.

Given that p = ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1/k², and q = ∑_{k=1}^∞ 1/k³.

Right, so probably, we need to manipulate this integral to express it in terms
